## Computer Science Majors
### Option 1 - Portfolio Website Competition 
#### Cost: $20 per Active 
The portfolio project competition for the Computer Science majors within Theta Tau is designed to showcase students' technical skills, creativity, and buidling their professional image. Those who chose to participate are invited to design, build and update their website in order to present a comprehensive portfolio that highlights their best projects, including coding assignments, collaborative projects, internships, personal projects, and any other work that demonstrates their proficiency in computer science.

In the ever competitive world of Computer Science it is important to stand out from the rest, and what better way than to not only build a portfolio website, but to win a competition that cements your portfolio as unique, techically impressive, and interactive in a way that warrents attention from any company that you may be applying to. Through this project competition you will be helping yourself professionally, have a shot at winning the prize, and most importantly; bragging rights!
